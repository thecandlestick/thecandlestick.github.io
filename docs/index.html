    <h2>About Me</h2> <img src="images/meandmydawg.jpg" alt="me">

	    <p> I love spending time out among the parks and forests of Missouri
	    and learning new & exciting things. At the time of writing this, my interests include programming, disc golf, 
	    and learning Mandarin Chinese. Math & science provide me with an endless string of pursuits, and I created
	    this website in part to serve as a resource to others. </p>

    <h2>Education</h2>

	    <p> I received my bachelor's from Missouri University of Science & Technology in May, 2022 with majors in 
	    computer science and applied mathematics. I am currently pursuing a master's degree in computer science at S&T
	    and exploring options for PhD programs. </p>
    
    <!-- <h2>Work Experience</h2> -->
    
    <h2>Research</h2> <img src=images/WNIS_Lab.jpg alt="my labmates" width=900 height=auto>

        <p> I perform research with the Wireless Networks and Intelligent Systems laboratory under the guidance 
        of <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/mst.edu/nancen">Dr. Nan Cen</a> </p>

        <h3>Past & Present Work</h3>

			<p> My work in WNIS is on Visible Light Communication (VLC). VLC is a form of wireless communication
			that offers an alternative to traditional radio-based wireless technology. The many benefits of VLC
			make it an ideal candidate to support the advancement of IoT and 6G wireless networks. My research aims
			to harness VLC for applications in healthcare, and to use it's unique properties to improve quality of
			care and standard of living for patients.</p>
        
        <h3>Research Interests</h3>

        	<ul>
        		<li>Wireless Communication</li>
				<li>Data Structures & Algorithms</li>
				<li>Natural Computation</li>
        	</ul>
        
    <h2>Personal & Professional Goals</h2>

        <p> I am seeking a career in academia. Education is very important to me, and I will always remain
        a student in pursuit of knowledge. Teaching is also an essential part of my personal learning 
        journey </p>
        
    <h2>Competitive Programming</h2>

   	 	<p> I spent several years serving as the chair for Missouri S&T's competitive programming team.
   	 	During my time as chair I learned about the art of competitive programming, represented S&T alongside
   	 	fellow students at the International Collegiate Programming Competition, organized events and contests
   	 	for S&T students, and ran instructional meetings and programs for competitive programmers. </p>

   	 	<h3>What is Competitive Programming</h3>

   	 		<p>Competitive Programming (CP) is a mind-sport that tests one's ability to solve classical problems in
   	 		computer science in a timely and efficient manner.</p>
   	 		
   	 	<h3>Who is Competitive Programming for</h3>

   	 		<p>The skills of abstract problem solving and quick, efficient implementation that are developed by CP
   	 		are valuable to all manners of developers and IT professionals. Thus, highly skilled competitive programmers
   	 		are sought after by employers, and interview processes for developer positions often include a technical 
   	 		component resembling CP. In summary, CP may be an excellent pursuit for:

   	 		<ul>
   	 			<li>Students looking to increase their chance of landing an internship or full-time position</li>
   	 			<li>Students motivated by DSA and looking to distinguish themselves as computer scientists</li>
   	 			<li>Professionals looking to further enhance their skills and marketability as developers</li>
   	 		</ul></p>
   	 		
   	 	<h3>How to get started</h3>

    		<p>There are a number of resources available for competitive programmers including texts, courses, and websites.
    		Those already comfortable programming in their language of choice can give CP a try at various sites providing 
    		a platform for practice and competitions such as LeetCode or Kattis</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2> <img src="images/meandmydawg.jpg" alt="me">

	    <p> I am at peace when out among the parks and forests of Missouri, spending time with friends and family,
	    and learning new & exciting things. At the time of writing this, my interests include programming, disc golf, 
	    and learning Mandarin Chinese. Math & science provide me with an endless string of pursuits, and I created
	    this website in part to serve as a resource to others. </p>

        <h3>Past & Present Work</h3>

			<p> My work in WNIS is on Visible Light Communication (VLC). VLC is a form of wireless communication
			that offers an alternative to traditional radio-based wireless technology. The many benefits of VLC
			make it an ideal candidate to support the advancement of IoT and 6G wireless networks. My research aims
			to harness VLC for applications in healthcare, and to use it's unique properties to improve quality of
			care and standard of living for patients.</p>
